- **Double-Stepping Mechanism**: Includes the famous rotor stepping anomaly
- **Plugboard System**: Full 26-letter plugboard with visual cable connections
- **German Interface**: Authentic German labels and terminology

### Interactive Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch rotors turn and lamps light up in real-time
- **Realistic Design**: Styled to look like the actual machine
- **Responsive Controls**: Click keyboard keys and see immediate encryption
- **Historical Accuracy**: Operates exactly like the original machine

### Educational Content
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Bilingual German/English operating manual
- **Historical Context**: Learn about WWII cryptography and code-breaking
- **Step-by-Step Tutorial**: Guided examples for beginners
- **Security Analysis**: Understand why Enigma was eventually broken

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Visit the Live Demo**: [https://vercel.com/eric-treacys-projects/v0-enigma-machine](https://vercel.com/eric-treacys-projects/v0-enigma-machine)

2. **Basic Setup for Testing**:
   - Set rotors to I-II-III
   - Set all positions to A-A-A
   - Leave plugboard empty
   - Start typing!

3. **Try the Example**:
   - Type "HELLO" ‚Üí Get "GCBLA"
   - Reset to A-A-A and type "GCBLA" ‚Üí Get "HELLO" back!

## üéÆ How to Use

### 1. Configure the Machine
- **Rotors**: Select 3 different rotors (I-V) and set their positions
- **Plugboard**: Connect letter pairs using the quick-connect buttons
- **Ring Settings**: Adjust internal wiring offsets (advanced)

### 2. Encrypt Messages
- Click keyboard keys to input your message
- Watch the lamp board light up with encrypted letters
- Rotors automatically advance after each letter

### 3. Decrypt Messages
- Use the same settings as encryption
- Type the encrypted message to get the original back
- Enigma is a reciprocal cipher - encryption = decryption

## üèõÔ∏è Historical Significance

The Enigma machine was Nazi Germany's primary encryption device during WWII, used to secure military communications across all branches of the Wehrmacht. Breaking the Enigma code was one of the greatest cryptographic achievements in history, involving brilliant minds like Alan Turing at Bletchley Park.

### Key Historical Facts:
- **Used by**: German military, navy, and intelligence services
- **Period**: 1930s-1945
- **Complexity**: 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 possible settings
- **Broken by**: Allied cryptanalysts using mathematical analysis and early computers
- **Impact**: Shortened WWII by an estimated 2-4 years

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Cryptographic Accuracy
- Implements authentic rotor wiring patterns from historical documents
- Correct stepping mechanism including the double-stepping anomaly
- Accurate plugboard substitution cipher
- Proper reflector implementation (Reflector B)

### Modern Web Technologies
- **React/Next.js**: Modern component-based architecture
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, authentic styling
- **Vercel**: Fast, reliable deployment
